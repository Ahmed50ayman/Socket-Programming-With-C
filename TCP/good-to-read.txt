##Socket in C
-->Sockets are low level endpoint used for processing information across a network
-->common networking protocols like HTTP and FTP rely on the sockets underneath to make connection
------------------------------
#client socket workflow

socket()
|
connect()
|
recv()

-->the client socket is created with a socket() call, and the connected to a remote address with the connect()
call, and then finally can retrive data with recv() call.
------------------------------
#server socket workflow

-->on the "server" end of the socket,we need to also create a socket with a socket() call,
but then,we need to bind(),that socket to an IP and port where it can then listen() for
connections, and then finally accept() a connection and then send() or recv() data to the
other sockets it has connected to

socket()
|
bind()
|
listen()
|
accept()
